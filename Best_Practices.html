<h2>🎯 Best Practices & Common Sense</h2>
<ul>
<li>🗣️ <strong>Communicate:</strong> Always inform your clanmates or leaders if you're planning something that might affect them or the clan, like opening a portal or triggering a war.</li>
<li>🏰 <strong>Protect assets:</strong> Don’t hoard resources or leave troops in city during events — use forts and clan buildings smartly.</li>
<li>💬 <strong>No toxic behavior:</strong> Trash talk, constant complaints or accusations ruin the fun. Stay civil and support your team.</li>
<li>📚 <strong>Learn game mechanics:</strong> Read event rules and guides. Ask for help instead of guessing.</li>
<li>🤝 <strong>Help clanmates:</strong> Donate, assist with building and marches, and support weaker members during KvK or CoT.</li>
<li>🔐 <strong>Keep shields up when inactive:</strong> Especially during war events. Don't let the enemy farm you for easy points.</li>
<li>⚖️ <strong>Play fair:</strong> Don’t exploit loopholes or bait players into violating rules, even if technically allowed.</li>
<li>🛡️ <strong>Stay protected:</strong> Your kingdom is always exposed to external threats. Never leave excess resources unprotected in your city.</li>
<li>⚔️ <strong>Act like it's war:</strong> If unshielded, treat every moment like it’s a KvK or CoT event — send troops to forts and hide your resources smartly.</li>
<li>📜 <strong>Follow ROE:</strong> One selfish move can create problems for your clan and friends. Know and follow the Rules of Engagement.</li>
<li>🪞 <strong>Golden rule:</strong> “Do not do to others what you wouldn’t want done to you.”</li>
<li>🔍 <strong>Scout first:</strong> If you farm resources from other kingdoms, always scout first. It’s faster, safer, and more respectful.</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>No low-might targets:</strong> Do not attack cities under 100k Might — not in your kingdom, nor others.</li>
<li>🏯 <strong>Respect buildings:</strong> Do not attack clan buildings.</li>
<li>⛏️ <strong>Respect mines:</strong> Do not attack mines outside your clan.</li>
</ul>
