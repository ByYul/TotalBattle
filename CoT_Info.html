<h2>🏰 Clash of Thrones (CoT) – Quick Guide</h2>
<h3>❓ What is CoT?</h3>
<p>Clash of Thrones (CoT) is a major PvP event that runs every 2 weeks for 2 days. Players earn <strong>Conquest Points (CP)</strong> through battles or secondary events. The top 100 earn the right to vote for the next King.</p>
<h3>🛡️ How to Protect Yourself</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shield your city</strong> for the entire event if you don’t want to participate.</li>
<li><strong>Hide your troops</strong> in the clan Fort.</li>
<li><strong>Send resources</strong> to clan buildings to avoid being looted.</li>
<li><strong>Never leave armies or resources exposed</strong> inside your city.</li>
</ul>
<h3>📣 CP Marches = Free CP!</h3>
<p>Sometimes your clan will organize special <strong>CP runs</strong> using <em>Clan Marches</em>. You can join as reinforcement and earn <strong>CP for free</strong>, without losing troops.</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch for announcements in clan chat.</li>
<li>Join quickly when invited to a march.</li>
<li>Follow instructions: no hero or gear unless told!</li>
</ul>
<h3>❗ Final Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do NOT defend your city — you lose troops and help the attacker.</li>
<li>Do NOT attack cities below 100k Might (check your kingdom’s ROE).</li>
<li>Ask leaders or check the CoT chat if you're unsure what to do.</li>
</ul>
