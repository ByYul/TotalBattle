<h2>📜 What is KvK (Kingdom vs Kingdom)?</h2>
<ul>
<li>KvK is a major PvP event in Total Battle where kingdoms fight to earn points through capturing enemy banners and completing objectives.</li>
<li>It is structured in leagues, and kingdoms are matched based on performance. Top kingdoms earn valuable rewards like Gold Ingots.</li>
</ul>

<h3>⚔️ How It Works</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capture &amp; Hold Banners:</strong> Your main goal is to capture enemy players’ banners and keep them in your city. The higher the city level (Capitol), the higher the banner value.</li>
<li><strong>Open Portals:</strong> Use portals to attack cities in other kingdoms. Coordinate with your clan for optimal results.</li>
<li><strong>No Shield with Banner:</strong> If you hold a banner, your city cannot be shielded. Banners stay with you until someone else defeats you in battle.</li>
</ul>
